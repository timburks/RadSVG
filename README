RadSVG is a simple (and incomplete) renderer for SVG Tiny 1.2 
that I frequently use in iOS apps. Typically I've used it
to render icons or other simple graphics that were exported
from Adobe Illustrator or another vector tool such as 
Sketch.

<text> elements are not supported and you may find many
other things missing. I generally just add things as I need
them.

The test SVG files in the samples directory are from the 
SVG Tiny 1.2 spec and belong to the W3C.
